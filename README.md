# Distributions in Data science

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis Summary

This Jupyter Notebook includes statistical analysis techniques commonly used in data science and research. The key topics covered are:

### 1. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**
- One-way ANOVA is used to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.
- Includes visualization (e.g., boxplots) and interpretation of p-values.
- Useful for hypothesis testing and group comparison.

### 2. **Distributions**
- Exploration of different data distributions such as normal, uniform, and skewed distributions.
- Includes histogram plots, probability density functions, and Q-Q plots.
- Demonstrates how to assess normality and identify skewness and kurtosis.

### 3. **Correlation**
- Calculation of correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman).
- Heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.
- Analysis of strength and direction of linear and non-linear relationships.
